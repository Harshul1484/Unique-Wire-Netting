                <p>The invention of the stainless steel wire cable mesh originated from the production of silk fabric
                    with a long history in China. How did weaving materials evolve from silk to stainless steel rope?

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Flexible stainless steel cable mesh can be traced back as early as
                        the Ming Dynasty. Flexible stainless steel cable mesh is known for being flexible and soft, and
                        yet durable. The wire cable handwoven mesh can be easily covered on the surface of a round or
                        umbrella shape, providing convenience for the installation.</p>
                    <p>In the 1990s, the flexible stainless steel wire rope mesh produced in Anping. After several
                        generations of Anping people's unremitting pursuit and hard work, the stainless steel wire rope
                        mesh has taken root, sprouted, and continued to grow in Anping.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">The development of stainless steel wire cable mesh is inseparable
                        from the rise and widespread use of stainless steel materials.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Stainless steel is a modern material with a century of development.
                        Since the invention of stainless steel, it has combined the image of modern materials with its
                        outstanding reputation in architectural applications. The <strong>stainless steel cable woven
                            mesh</strong> is also a new type of material that has only been developed in recent decades.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Stainless steel will not corrosion, pitting, rust, or wear. It is
                        also one of the strongest materials among metal materials for construction. Because stainless
                        steel has good corrosion resistance, it can make structural components permanently maintain the
                        integrity of engineering design, which can meet the needs of architects and structural
                        designers.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Stainless steel is divided into many grades according to its
                        composition. The most commonly used raw materials for stainless steel wire rope mesh are two
                        types: AISI304 and AISI316. These two materials are very suitable for wire ropes production and
                        weaving mesh.</p>
                    <p>304 stainless steel woven mesh is suitable for most indoor and outdoor environments. The
                        marine-grade 316 stainless steel wire rope mesh is more corrosion-resistant and can be used in
                        humid environments like the seaside.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 60px;">
                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Processing Technology of Stainless Steel Cable Mesh</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">UNIQUE WIRE NETTING Mesh has two types of mesh: <strong>stainless steel
                        wire rope woven mesh</strong> and <strong>stainless steel wire rope ferrule mesh</strong>.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">The processing of stainless steel wire cable mesh is purely hand-woven,
                    so far no machine can complete this process. Therefore, it is very important to choose a soft and
                    durable raw material.</p>
                <p>The difference between the cable ferrule mesh and the hand-woven stainless steel mesh is the
                    connection of two ropes. The stainless steel ferrule mesh is very beautiful and shows its
                    temperament. It is mostly used for decoration and railing filling net. At the same time, it can also
                    be used in other buildings.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">The stainless steel wire rope woven mesh is made up of multiple
                        parallel pairs of wire cables connected to each other through braided knots.</p>
                    <p>Cable woven mesh is very transparent and the structure is simple but tight, hence, most zoos and
                        bird gardens are fond of wire cable woven mesh. Especially, stainless steel cable woven mesh is
                        lighter than the ferrule mesh.</p>
                </div>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">The stainless steel wire rope ferrule mesh is formed by connecting
                        parallel stainless steel cables and stainless steel ferrules or sleeves.</p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Wire rope mesh with ferrules is more beautiful in appearance.
                        Therefore, cable ferrule mesh is more suitable for decoration. It always used as the railing
                        fillings, and stair railings, safety nets. Besides appearance, stainless steel wire rope ferrule
                        mesh can also provide security for people and animals.</p>
                    <p>The stainless steel rope mesh and stainless steel cable ferrule mesh have versatility and
                        durability, so they can be used in animal fences or enclosures to provide a safety barrier while
                        maintaining its aesthetic appearance. Unlike traditional plastic nets, stainless steel wire rope
                        mesh is absolutely UV resistant and weather resistant.</p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 60px;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Multi-strand twisted stainless steel wire rope is very suitable for
                    weaving flexible stainless steel rope mesh, generally, 7*7 strands or 7*19 strands are used. The
                    wire rope diameter ranges from 1.2mm to 4.0mm. The smallest wire cable mesh aperture that can be
                    woven with different rope diameters is also different.</p>
                <p>For example, the smallest mesh aperture of a 1.2mm steel wire rope can reach 15mm, however, its
                    production is also very time-consuming and expensive. The most common stainless steel aviary mesh
                    apertures are 25mm(1") and 51mm(2"). The 3.2mm wire rope has a minimum mesh of 51mm, which is mostly
                    used by large cats and stainless steel zoo fence.</p>
